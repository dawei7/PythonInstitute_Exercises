# PythonInstitute_Exercises

## Purpose
While going through the free online courses from "https://pythoninstitute.org/", I will post my personal solutions to the exercises in this repository.
There is no guarantee for correctness, completeness or the best possible solution.
It serves mainly to keep track of myself and to stay motivated.
